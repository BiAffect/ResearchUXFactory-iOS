How can we better manage the symptoms of SAMPLE together? <br /><br />

People with SAMPLE have different symptoms. These symptoms can change day-to-day and over time. The purpose of this study is to help us understand the different symptoms of SAMPLE. The results of this study may help researchers develop new ways to manage SAMPLE symptoms.<br/><br/>

This study uses an app to monitor SAMPLE symptoms. Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) has developed this app to make it easier for people to participate in this research.<br /><br />

If you participate in this study, you will be asked to complete surveys and activities. The activities use your phoneâ€™s built-in sensors to collect information about your health and the symptoms of SAMPLE -- like balance and dexterity.<br /><br />

If you are over 18 years old, you can join the study. We are looking for volunteers with SAMPLE and volunteers who do not have SAMPLE (&quot;controls&quot;) to join this research study. Both groups are important to the study.</p>

 The `SBAAppExtensionSharedInfoController` is a light-weight object that can be used to 
 manage the user and bridge info for an app extension. This class assumes that the current
 user and bridge info use the shared singletons defined on `SBAUser` and `SBABridgeInfoPList`,
 respectively.
 
 @note syoung 10/05/2017 WIP that is not tested by any of Sage Bionetworks' currently
 released applications.
